# Laravel + Livewire Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our Laravel + [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Livewire frontend.

Livewire is a powerful way of building dynamic, reactive, frontend UIs using just PHP. It's a great fit for teams that primarily use Blade templates and are looking for a simpler alternative to JavaScript-driven SPA frameworks like React and Vue.

This Livewire starter kit utilizes Livewire 4, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [Flux UI](https://fluxui.dev) component library.

If you are looking for the alternate configurations of this starter kit, they can be found in the following branches:

- [workos](https://github.com/laravel/livewire-starter-kit/tree/workos) - if WorkOS is selected for authentication
